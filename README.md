# Weather

## Overview
This is a simple application which is designed to perform basic API queries using Retrofit
to retrieve the latest weather values from an API. The data provided shows a basic overview
of the current weather for the next 6 days and provides a detailed overview of the weather
conditions when a card is clicked.

This application was created as a demonstration of my abilities to create a simple Android
application using gradle in order to qualify for a High Distinction grade in my COS30017
unit.
